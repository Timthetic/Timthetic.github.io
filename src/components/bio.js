			Iâ€™m a senior at UCLA studying Computer Science. I think the opportunity to learn is one of the most valuable things in a career. Some of my skills are programming in C++, JavaSript, Go, Lisp, Ruby on Rails, and Swift. I also help others learn software development as a part of UCLA ACM Hack where we teach a variety of programming skills. Although I focus on building software, teaching is something that I have always loved.
